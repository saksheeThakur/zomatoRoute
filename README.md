# 🚚 Delivery Route Optimization (A* Algorithm)

A Python desktop application using **Tkinter** that helps determine the most efficient delivery route between multiple locations using the **A\* (A-Star) Algorithm**.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add delivery routes (bidirectional) with distances
- ✅ Input start and end locations
- ✅ Find the shortest delivery path using A* algorithm
- ✅ Clean and interactive GUI with real-time route output

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

This app uses the **A\* Search Algorithm** (with zero heuristic, equivalent to Dijkstra’s algorithm in this case) to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **heapq** for priority queue in A* implementation
