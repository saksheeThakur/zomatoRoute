# 🚚 Delivery Route Optimization (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

A Python desktop application built using **Tkinter** that determines the most efficient delivery route between multiple locations using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add delivery routes (bidirectional) with distances
- ✅ Input start and end locations
- ✅ Find the shortest delivery path using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**
- ✅ Interactive and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter
- ✅ Real-time route display and clear path output

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

This application uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest path between two nodes in a **weighted undirected graph**.

> Dijkstra’s algorithm always selects the node with the minimum known distance, ensuring the shortest path is found efficiently.  
> Note: The heuristic used in A* is set to 0 in this implementation, making it equivalent to Dijkstra's algorithm.
